## About

This is a **solid path** for those of you who want to complete a **Bioinformatics** course on your own time, **for free**, with courses from the **best universities** in the World.

In our curriculum, we give preference to MOOC (Massive Open Online Course) style courses because these courses were created with our style of learning in mind.

To become a bioinformatician, you have to learn quiet a lot of life science, so be ready for subjects like; Biology, Chemistry, etc...

## Becoming an OSS student

To officially register for this course you must create a profile in our [web app](https://ossu.firebaseapp.com).

**ps**: Currently, the web app is for tracking the progress of the [Computer Science](https://github.com/open-source-society/computer-science) path, but we are working to extend this functionality for all of our courses. Thanks for the comprehension.

> **"How can I do this?"**

Just create an account on GitHub and log in with this account in our web app.

The intention of this app is to offer for our students a way to track their progress, and also the ability to show their progress through a public page for friends, family, employers, etc.

In the "My Progress" tab, you are able to edit the status of the courses that you are taking, and also add the link of your final project for each one.

## Motivation & Preparation

Here are two interesting links that can make **all** the difference in your journey.

The first one is a motivational video that shows a guy that went through the "MIT Challenge", which consists of learning the entire **4-year** MIT curriculum for Computer Science in **1 year**.

- [MIT Challenge](https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/myprojects/mit-challenge-2/)

The second link is a MOOC that will teach you learning techniques used by experts in art, music, literature, math, science, sports, and many other disciplines. These are **fundamental abilities** to succeed in our journey.
